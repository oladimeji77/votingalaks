This module contains config.py and env for setting the environment variables

so that variables are not hard coded

Implementing voting on blogs requires a composite key
composite keys uses more than one primary key in a table
we create a vote table in models.py 

Github actions
create a directory .github
inside it create a dir workflows
create a yaml file with a .yml ext eg main.yml
name: Python package   #name of the project, could be anything
on: [push]              #trigger could be [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  deploy:               #name of the job is deploy, could be anything e.g goat, test, build etc
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  #the os the github runner will run on
    needs: [build]          #needs another job called build to run successfully before it runs
    environment:            #environment where the secrets key is taken
      name: production      #name of the enviroment
    steps:                  #where the actuall CI steps takes place
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Echo wassup
        run: echo "welcome to the main deployment"

You can create an environment variables from github
navigate settings > secrets and variables > actions 
create an envirronment eg test or production or UAT
You can now add secret keys to the environments as per need basis
env: 
      DATABASE_HOSTNAME: ${{secrets.DATABASE_HOSTNAME}}
      DATABASE_PORT: ${{secrets.DATABASE_PORT}}
      project_title: Voting Online Noun #this one is hard coded



user =  relationship("AccreditedUserDB", back_populates="elect") back populates matches the relation name of the other table
